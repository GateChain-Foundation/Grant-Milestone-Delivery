# Grant-Milestone-Delivery  
ðŸ“¢ Repository to submit finished milestones

The Milestone Delivery process is part of the Gate.io grant program. You can find the [application process](https://github.com/GateChain-Foundation/Grant-Milestone-Delivery) here

## Milestone Delivery
a.  Fork this code base using the same GitHub account you used to submit your application.   
b.  In the newly created branch, create a copy of the milestone delivery template ( deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md). If you are using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the contents of the template into the new file; do not modify the template file directly.    
c.  Name the file project_name-milestone.md.  
d.  Fill out the template using the milestone details, including the link to request a Pull Request.   
e.  When finished, create a Pull Request.  

## Milestone Review
a.  Foundations can comment on Pull Requests and request changes, and their feedback needs   to be addressed before your milestone can be accepted.  
b.  The Foundation will merge your Pull Request to accept delivery.

## Milestone Payment
a.  Once the delivery is accepted, the Foundation will make payment to the GateChain address specified in the initial application.
